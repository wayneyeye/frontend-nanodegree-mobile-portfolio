## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

### Below are the optimizations applied to the index.html
- 1. Grunt the network-consuming images (pizzeria).
- 2. Set media query for the stylesheet (print.css) dedicated for printing purpose.
- 3. Use internal font-family (sans-serif) instead of requesting from google fonts.



####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.
